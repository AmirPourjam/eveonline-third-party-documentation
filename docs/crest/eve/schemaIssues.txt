1. EndpointCollection cache time is 20 seconds - expected much longer

2. in the schema of schema application/vnd.ccp.eve.Options-v1+json - 
   representation 1.  I did not see this "contentType" field in the returned data
   
	name: contentType
	description: null
	optional: true
	extraData: null
	typePrettyName: Dictionary
	type: Dict
	
3. see the options.txt dump, search "look here" and find the "corporations"
   only the schema representation is returned not the value representation. 
4. see the options.txt dump, 3rd look here or so.  DecodeToken's two 
representations are swapped compared to all others I've seen.
